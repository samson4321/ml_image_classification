Project Notes - Task 2

- Ensure dataset paths are correct before running the notebook
- Image size is fixed at 128x128 for all models
- Batch size is set to 8
- Data augmentation is used to reduce overfitting
- ResNet50 uses ImageNet pretrained weights
- Evaluation includes both statistical and visual metrics
- GPU is recommended for faster training

Common Issues:
- Missing dataset folders
- Incorrect class labels
- TensorFlow version mismatch

Recommended:
- Use a virtual environment
- Run on Google Colab or GPU-enabled system
